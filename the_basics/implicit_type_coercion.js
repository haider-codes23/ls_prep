// one of the values is a string and the other one is a number with a '+' operator between them 
// which instructs the computer to join the two values but how could javascript join a string and with a number.
// when  js encounters a string with a number it tells the computer to convert the number into a string
// as well, its called impilict coercion and then it concatenates '10' with the string '5' which results in 
// a string with the value '510'

console.log('5' + 10);
